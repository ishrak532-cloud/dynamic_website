Database
We designed the CRUD based functionality inside the admin panel also in the homepage of the website the live stats is connected.

JS validation and events
We included JS validation and events on search bar and in the offer form.

UI design
We designed the UI beautifully with matching colors so that it looks attractive.

Database Tables
Md. Ishrak Rahman(Team Lead): Offer Form table and admin requests
Mia Md Husain: car ad update
Simanto Rahat: Live stats
Include the ER Diagram of the database.

Created Forms
We have created an offer form in cars.php from where users can send request to buy a car also we included js in it so thats why
the user can't put any invalid or empty data. Also the car model box updates automatically when we add a new car from admin panel.
Also the user needs to put a valid phone address otherwise the submit button will not work.
Admin panel:
Username: admin
Password: 1234
Form 1:Send Offer form: Link to the related code file (github) |http://shell.hamk.fi/~amk1011334/webdev/src/xcar/cars.php | Validations Applied
